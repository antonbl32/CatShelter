# CatShelter
Cat shelter database

There is a small cat shelter that's managed by volunteers and is being watched closely by Greenpeace.

The main duty of the shelter workers is to feed cats. 
Workers do not like to coordinate feeding time with each other.
Each cat should be fed not more than once in 4 hours.
Greenpeace requires us to share statistics about each cat and volunteer,
as lazy volunteers need to be banned from the shelter.

We need to build a backed/REST system to support the lifecycle of the shelter:
- Show a list of hungry cats on large TV screen.
- A button to tap that marks a cat as just fed on each of employee's phone.
- Statistic report about a cat. When the cat was fed and who did it.
- Statistic about volunteer. How many cats each employee fed in last week.

Task needs to be delivered as GitHub repository with development history.
